# Nueral Networks, Module 13 Challenge - Columbia Fintech Bootcamp

# Objective: 
the objective of this project is to compile, evaluate and, tune a binary classification model using a Neural Network that predicts if applicants will be successful if funded through venture capital firm.

Scenario - Given a historical dataset CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding, employ neural network knowledge to evaluate dataset features and create a binary classifier model that will predict an applicant will become a successful or failed business.

# Dependencies
This project requires the following packages:
Tensorflow - powerful library for building nueral networks from scratch using python.

Keras - An Api for tensorflow that makes it more verbose and makes calls easier to work with syntactically.

sys - module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

NumPy - an open source Python library used for working with arrays, contains multidimensional array and matrix data structures with functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

pandas - software library written for the python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

Path - from pathlib - Object-oriented filesystem paths, Path instantiates a concrete path for the platform the code is running on.

train_test_split - from sklearn.model_selection, a quick utility that wraps input validation and next(ShuffleSplit().split(X, y)) and application to input data into a single call for splitting (and optionally subsampling) data in a oneliner.

OneHotEncoder - from sklearn.preprocessing, encode categorical features as a one-hot numeric array. Features are encoded using a one-hot (aka ‘one-of-K’ or ‘dummy’) encoding scheme; creates a binary column for each category and returns a sparse matrix or dense array.

StandardScaler - from sklearn.preprocessing, standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
